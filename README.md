``👩🏻‍💻`` Hi, My name is Katrina Tran! I'm currently a software developer. I graduated last year from San José State University with an M.S. in Computer Science. I also did my undergrad in Computer Science and minored in Mathematics. I'm interested in the field of security and machine learning. I also like to work with data.

``⌨️`` My technical skills: 
> - languages: Java, Python, C++, SQL
> - markup: HTML, CSS, Markdown
> - softwares/platforms: MySQL, AWS, Eclipse, PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, Oracle VM VirtualBox, Jupyter Notebook
> - areas that I have worked with a little bit: Prolog, Racket, NoSQL, Cassandra, Javascript, Ruby, PHP

``( •̀ ω •́ )✧`` Some of my interests and hobbies:
> - ``📖`` I love to read. Last year (2022) I reached my goodreads goal early so I increased it; but I hit it again. I'm ended up at 64 books total. This year I've been a bit slower. I'm at 28 books but I'm starting to pick it up again.
> - ``🍕`` I love to eat. As per the emoji, I love pizza! I also enjoy kbbq, hot pot, hủ tiếu khô, and mì khô. I also love desserts and candies like M&Ms, crêpes, and ice cream.
> - ``🥐`` I bake. I'm pretty proud of my brioche and Choux au Craquelin.
> - ``👨‍👩‍👧‍👧`` I spend a lot of time with my friends and family.
> - ``🌲`` I enjoy going out to parks, relaxing on the grass, and playing games.
> - ``🧶`` I learned how to knit and crochet when I was younger and I picked up crochet again recently. I've been really into making flowers and the cute sprouts. [🌱]

``(❁´◡`❁)`` Some projects I'm currently working on/news with me:
> - ``🔐`` My Master's Project, "Robustness of Image-Based Malware Analysis", was accepted for presentation and publication in the Proceedings of 3rd International Silicon Valley Cybersecurity Conference 2022!
