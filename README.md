``👩🏻‍💻`` Hi, my name is Katrina! I'm currently working as a software developer focused in backend and MLOps. I graduated from San José State University with an M.S. in Computer Science. I also did my undergrad in Computer Science and minored in Mathematics. I'm interested in the field of security and machine learning.

``⌨️`` My technical skills: 
> - languages: Java, Python, Javascript, C++, SQL/NoSQL

``( •̀ ω •́ )✧`` Some of my interests and hobbies:
> - ``📖`` I love to read. In the year 2022, I reached my goodreads goal early so I increased it; but I hit it again. I ended up at 64 books total. I've slowed down since with only 7 books so far this year.
> - ``🍕`` I love to eat. As per the emoji, I love pizza! I also enjoy kbbq, hot pot, hủ tiếu khô, and mì khô. I also love desserts and candies like M&Ms, crêpes, and ice cream.
> - ``🥐`` I bake. I'm pretty proud of my brioche, pretzel, and Choux au Craquelin.
> - ``👨‍👩‍👧‍👧`` I spend a lot of time with my friends and family.
> - ``🌲`` I enjoy going out to parks, relaxing on the grass, and playing games.
> - ``🧶`` I learned how to knit and crochet when I was younger and I picked up crochet again recently. I've been really into making flowers and the cute sprouts. [🌱]
